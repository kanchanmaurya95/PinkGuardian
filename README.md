Introduction
Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. Pink Guardian utilizes advanced AI to provide accessible diagnostic tools directly through a mobile application, making early screenings more available and reducing barriers to access.

Project Description
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive system that employs the BC-InceptionV3 model trained to classify mammogram images as benign or malignant. The model is trained in Python notebooks on Kaggle, converted to TensorFlow Lite, and then integrated into an Android app for easy user accessibility.

Model Development
Dataset Overview
The BC-InceptionV3 model is trained on high-quality mammographic images that provide a diverse basis for learning distinguishing features between benign and malignant tumors.

Training on Kaggle
The model training is executed in a Python notebook hosted on Kaggle, leveraging its GPU resources to efficiently handle the computational demands of training a deep learning model.

Conversion to TensorFlow Lite
Post-training, the model is converted to TensorFlow Lite to optimize performance for mobile devices, ensuring that the app runs smoothly across a wide range of smartphones.

App Details
Integration with Mobile App
The TensorFlow Lite model is integrated into the Pink Guardian mobile app, providing users with real-time analysis of mammogram images. This integration allows for immediate preliminary diagnostics to be made accessible on user's devices.
